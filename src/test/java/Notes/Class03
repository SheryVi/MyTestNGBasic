****************TestNG Class03**************
TestNG XML
helps us control the execution of the test cases.


1.  <suite>
        <test>
            <classes>
                 <class name="class name"/>
                 <class name="class name">
                                <methods>
                                        <include name="method name"/>
                                </methods>
                 </class>
            </classes>
                 <packages>
                     <package name="package name/">
                 </packages>
        </test>
    </suite>

When we run a specific method from a class, if it has any before and after method
they will also be executed even if we don't select them to run!!!

***********Executing our test cases on group level*************
1. when we execute in our XML using groups,
by default the @beforeMethod and @afterMethod WILL NOT execute!!!
ONLY the methods tagged that particular group will be executed!!!

In order to deal with this problem, because if we have any @BeforeMethod
where we are doing some initializations we the following method
i.e
put (alwaysRun = "true") in front of your @beforeMethod and @afterMethod

Whenever you are running by groups and u get an error of NULL pointer Exception
the first thing to check is.....
"@beforeMethod is set to alwaysRun=true"
--------------------------------------------------------

ListenersClass:

Listeners Class listen to events like test failed/ pass/ skipped etc
once the testcase has executed
and it either /fails /pass /skips
depending upon the status
listeners class takes you to the execution of the code that you have written for
the scenarios if you test case fails/pass or /skips

Implementation of listeners class:

Listeners class implements ITestListeners
witch is an interface from TestNG
and we override the functions according to our need

after that you need to link the listeners class to the class on which you want it to listen
that can be done using TestNG.XML

u define ur <listeners> tag just under <suite> and than write down the classes u want it to listen to.

************ DataProvider in TestNG ***********
Data Provider is used for data driven testing.
Use data provider for small data sets
for greater one use excel

if we want to declare our data set it must be under @dataProvider

if we want our test case to utilize this dataProvider
what do we need?
@Test(dataProvider = "name of dataProvider")
public void test(){

}

*********** Parallel testing ***********
